            Facilitating the transmission of shares often involves navigating
            legal intricacies and complexities, and our services at Raed India
            are tailored to offer comprehensive support to our clients. Some
            common challenges encountered in this process include:
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Clarifying Transfer vs. Transmission: A frequent stumbling block
            is the confusion surrounding the distinction between the transfer
            and transmission of shares. The Companies Act makes a clear
            delineation: transfers are voluntary actions by shareholders, while
            transmissions occur automatically through legal processes, such as a
            will or agreement. Unlike transfers, transmissions involve the
            transfer of shares without any consideration.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. Diverse Company Holdings: In cases where the deceased shareholder
            held shares in multiple companies, our services entail submitting
            requisite documents and share certificates to each company
            individually. This necessitates consistent follow-up with each
            company to ensure the seamless transmission of shares.
            <br />
            <br />
            3. Challenges with Joint Holdings: Complications may arise when the
            deceased was one of the joint holders of securities. In such
            situations, the surviving holders must maintain a depository account
            and adhere to prescribed procedures for the transmission of shares.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our dedicated team at Raed India is equipped to address these
            challenges, providing expert guidance throughout the entire process
            of share transmission to streamline the experience for our clients.
